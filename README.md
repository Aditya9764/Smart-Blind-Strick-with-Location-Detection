# Smart-Blind-Strick-with-Location-Detection

A smart stick concept is devised to provide a smart electronic aid for blind people. Blind 
and visually impaired find difficulties in detecting obstacles during walking in the street. 
The system is intended to provide artificial vision and object detection,  real-time assistance 
via making use of IoT. 


The main objective of our project is to provide IOT-based assistance to blind people. 
The existing devices for the visually impaired only focus on traveling from one location 
to another. 


The device is aimed to help the visually impaired with the same maneuver as that of sighted 
people. 


A brief study had been carried out to understand various issues related to the project which 
involves providing a smart electronic aid for blind people to provide artificial vision and 
object detection, real assistance via GPS module by using IOT. Our project mainly focuses 
on visually impaired people who cannot walk independently environment. 




The system consists of ultrasonic sensors, and the feedback is received through audio. The 
aim of the overall system is to provide a low-cost and efficient navigation and obstacle 
detection aid for the blind which gives a sense of artificial by providing 
information about the environmental scenario of static and dynamic objects round them, so 
that they can walk independently.
